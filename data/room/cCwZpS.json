Let’s brainstorm some perspectives that focus on how college students, particularly, use or could use generative AI effectively within their studies. For example, consider discussing potential benefits and drawbacks for college students, or focusing on specific academic areas where AI might be most beneficial. David, since we haven't heard from you yet, do you have any ideas or experiences related to how generative AI might impact college students? This could help us enrich our exploration of perspectives.",

To make this exploration phase more effective, each member could share a unique story or find specific information relating to how AI impacts learning behaviors, both positively and negatively. \n\nAdditionally, try to incorporate personal anecdotes or recent studies that might better illustrate these points. This will not only enrich our exploration but also help each of you connect closely with different dimensions of the topic. \n\nDavid, if you have any relevant insights or can pose questions to further ignite this exploration, that would be beneficial for keeping engagement high!",
